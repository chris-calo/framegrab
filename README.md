And it will create a picture file for you in the same folder as your video.

<details>
<summary><b>The video exists but I get "file does not exist" error</b></summary>

Make sure you're using the correct path to your video. For example:

- On macOS: Use `~/Documents/myvideo.mp4` for files in your Documents folder
- On Windows: Use full paths like `C:\Users\YourName\Videos\myvideo.mp4`
- On Linux: Use `~/Videos/myvideo.mp4` for files in your Videos folder

If your path has spaces, put it in quotes:
- macOS: `./framegrab.sh "~/My Videos/birthday party.mp4" 01:23.456`
- Windows: `.\framegrab.ps1 "C:\Users\YourName\My Videos\birthday party.mp4" 01:23.456`
- Linux: `./framegrab.sh "~/My Videos/birthday party.mp4" 01:23.456`
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The screenshot is black or incorrect</b></summary>

This could happen if:
1. The timestamp is beyond the length of the video
2. The video format is unusual or corrupted

Try a different timestamp or check if the video plays correctly in a media player.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I find the exact timestamp I want?</b></summary>

1. Play your video in VLC media player or similar
2. Pause at the exact frame you want
3. Note the time displayed (usually at the bottom of the player)
4. Use that time as your timestamp
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My screenshot is low quality</b></summary>

The tool creates screenshots at the same quality as your video. If your video is low resolution, the screenshot will be too.
